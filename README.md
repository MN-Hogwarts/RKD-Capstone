# RKD-Capstone

Programmed a 5-dof robot armâ€™s kinematics and created a system that followed a constrained path through space. The robot was programmed to pick up Jenga blocks from a feeder and place them to build a tower 6 layers high, with each subsequent layer being rotated 90 degrees. Key concepts utilized includes: Manipulability, Denavit-Hartenberg Transformations, Robot Control using trajectories, and 3D Inverse and Differential Kinematics.
